<div class="innertube"><b>FlowChart</b> A flowchart is a blueprint that pictorially represents the algorithm and its steps. The steps of a flowchart do not have a specific size and shape rather it is designed in different shapes and sizes.<br><h2>Benefits of Flowchart</h2>
 <br> Let us now discuss the benefits of a flowchart.<br>
  
  <h3>Simplify the Logic</h3>
  As it provides the pictorial representation of the steps; therefore, it simplifies the logic and subsequent steps.<br>
  
 <h3>Makes Communication Better</h3> 
  Because of having easily understandable pictorial logic and steps, it is a better and simple way of representation.<br>
  
  <h3>Effective Analysis</h3>
  Once the flow-chart is prepared, it becomes very simple to analyze the problem in an effective way.<br>
  
  <h3>Useful in Coding</h3>
  The flow-chart also helps in coding process efficiently, as it gives directions on what to do, when to do, and where to do. It makes the work easier.<br>
  
  <h3>Proper Testing</h3>
  Further, flowchart also helps in finding the error (if any) in program</div>
